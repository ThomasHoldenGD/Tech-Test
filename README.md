# Tech-Test
Sky Betting &amp; Gaming Tech Test (Project Penny Blossoms)

Technology used is nothing spectacular.

Notepad++ - I've been using this since university and it's been good to me, it's handled all the code i've supplied for previous placements for both game designing and website development.

XAMPP - For local host testing/Apache/php management (SQL is a nice touch but I prefer HeidieSQL.) and I used this since It's what has helped me from the beginning too.
